                      Tenacity’s mission is to close college information gaps facing underserved communities (i.e. low income and first generation students). Tenacity uses online tools and content to ensure that everyone has the confidence and know-how to pursue higher education or to support others in doing so. We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy rights of our students and mentors (“users”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This Privacy Policy discloses privacy practices for www.mytenacity.org (“Site”), Tenacity’s mobile text message feature, and Tenacity’s mentorship component (all three collectively “the Service”).  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Service.

                      <strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>General</i><br>
                      Tenacity uses information collected by the Service consistent with our mission.
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          We may sell and/or share certain data to higher education institutions only from users who have opted to be contacted by third-party organizations. Such data may include extracurricular activities student users have tracked and identified as participating in or schools that student users have on their college lists.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          We may de-identify and/or aggregate information that users provide to conduct research in collaboration with higher education institutions.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>Basic Account Information</i><br>
                      When students or mentors create an online user account, we collect personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: first name, last name, grade level, email address, password, and phone number (optional). We use users’ telephone numbers only to send weekly text message reminders. Users may opt-out of this feature at any time.
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          Users’ phone numbers are shared with Twilio, a company which administers the text message functionality. Twilio stores the phone numbers and SMS logs securely. Tenacity will not otherwise share the contents of text messages.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>Additional Information</i><br>
                      When the student user completes tasks on the online portal, we may also collect a wide variety of academic, extracurricular, financial, and personal information as it pertains to the college preparation process. This information is subject to change at any time as we revise and improve our content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <i>Pilot Programs</i><br>
                      Some individuals may be invited to participate in pilot programs in collaboration with community organizations or educational institutions. If your user account is created during a pilot program, the community organizer, counselor, point of contact, or leader in charge of the program will automatically be given access to your account. If you wish to revoke this third-party’s access to your account, you must forfeit participation in the pilot program.
